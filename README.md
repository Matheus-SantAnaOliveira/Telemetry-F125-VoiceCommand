# Telemetry-F125-VoiceCommand
A real-time telemetry system for F1 25 using .NET, Elasticsearch, and local voice commands to control live Kibana dashboards. Based on official EA telemetry documentation, the game streams UDP data to a .NET worker, which processes and indexes it in real time. Voice commands let users open and switch dashboards without leaving the race.
